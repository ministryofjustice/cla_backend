        "raw_body": "## Your details\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-has_partner\">Do you have a partner?</h3>\n\nLegal aid is calculated on both you and your partner's money. A 'partner' is someone you're married to or live with as if you're married.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-on_nass_benefits\">Are you on National Asylum Support Service benefits?</h3>\n\nNational Asylum Support Service (NASS) benefits are paid to eligible destitute asylum seekers as vouchers. Note that NASS benefits will only allow someone to automatically qualify for legal aid through the means test if the matter is an immigration one.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-on_passported_benefits\">Are you or your partner on any of these benefits? (Read out this list to client)</h3>\n\n* Income Support\n* Income-Based Job Seeker's Allowance *(but not contributions-based)*\n* Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance\n* Guarantee Credit\n* Universal Credit\n\nBeing on any of the benefits listed above means that a person automatically qualifies through the income part of the means test, although they can still be ineligible if they have too much capital. These benefits are known as \"passporting benefits\". \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-over_60\">Are you or your partner aged 60 or over?</h3>\n\nA person who is over 60 is entitled to extra capital allowances on the means test, based on their income.\n\n## Your properties\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_worth\">How much is the property worth?</h3>\n\nUse the client's estimate, or an online price comparison site.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_mortgage_left\">How much is left to pay on the mortgage?</h3>\n\nInclude the full amount owing - a property with shared ownership will still have one mortgage. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_disputed\">Is this property disputed?</h3>\n\nIs a partner seeking to claim the property? Is a creditor or mortgage company seeking to force the sale? If so, additional allowances will apply. Look in guidance for 'SMOD' for more guidance on scenarios.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_main\">Is this your main property?</h3>\n\nLegal aid is based on how much money you have. That means any property you own must be considered, even if you don't live in it. \n\nYour main property is the home you live in. This includes caravans, houseboats or other vehicles. \n\nIf you're separated and now living somewhere else, your former home is no longer your main property. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-property_share\">What percentage of the property do you (and/or your partner) own?</h3>\n\nSelect 100% if the property is solely owned by the client or their partner, or jointly owned with their partner.\n\nIf the property is jointly owned with an opponent, enter 50% (assuming equal share held) or enter an appropriate percentage if another party has an interest in the property.\n\n## Savings\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-undisputed_savings\">Undisputed savings</h3>\n\nUndisputed savings are savings where the ownership is not disputed by anyone eg an ex-partner is not trying to claim them as part of the financial settlement of a divorce or separation. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-disputed_savings\">Disputed savings</h3>\n\nDisputed savings are savings where the ownership of the savings is disputed by someone eg an ex-partner is seeking to claim a share as part of a divorce or separation. Look in guidance for 'SMOD' for more guidance on scenarios.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-savings_bank_balance\">Do you have any money saved in a bank or building society?</h3>\n\nThis includes all savings in any type of bank, building society or post office savings account. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-savings_investments\">Do you have any investments, shares and ISAs?</h3>\n\nThis includes all investments including shares, bonds and ISAs. \n\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-savings_valuable_items\">Do you have any valuable items over \u00a3500 each?</h3>\n\nInclude any single item you own worth over \u00a3500, but not:\n\n* household furniture and effects, unless they're of exceptional value\n* clothes\n* tools of your trade (eg computers for a graphic designer, carpentry tools for a carpenter)\n* the car or vehicle you use regularly, unless it's a classic car or luxury vehicle\n\nFor classic cars, luxury vehicles and valuable household furniture and effects, give the value the item would sell for if you sold it today. \n\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-savings_money_owned\">Do you have any money owed to you?</h3>\n\nWe need to know about any money owed to you by someone else because this can affect your financial eligibility for legal aid. Money owed to you includes money owed by friends and relatives as well as businesses and other individuals. \n\n## Your income\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-earnings\">Earnings last month</h3>\n\nThe total amount of money you earned before tax. Check your most recent payslips. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-se_drawings\">Self Employed Drawings (Before Tax)</h3>\n\nThe total amount of money you have drawings from your business for personal use in the last month.\n\nIf no drawings have been taken in the last month, or the most recent month\u2019s drawings appear low, then consideration should be given as to whether the client is attempting to deliberately reduce his or her income for the purpose of qualifying for civil legal services. If the client states that they have not taken any drawings from the business for their personal use then enquiries should be made of the client to determine how they have met their day to day living costs during the relevant period.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-benefits\">Benefits</h3>\n\nOther state benefits received each week must be included as a source of income unless exempted.\n\nSome benefits do not need to be declared as income - search the guidance for 'disregarded benefits' to see a list of these. All other benefits should be included as income.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-tax_credits\">Tax Credits</h3>\n\nOther tax credits, including Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credits must be declared.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-child_benefits\">Child Benefit (for household)</h3>\n\nChild Benefit (for household).\n\n[Gov.uk rates and allowances.] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-tax-credits-child-benefit-and-guardians-allowance/rates-and-allowances-tax-credits-child-benefit-and-guardians-allowance#child-benefit-rates) - **right-click and open in new window**\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-maintenance_received\">Maintenance Received</h3>\n\nAny money paid to you, for you or your child\u2019s living expenses, from an ex-partner or the other parent of your child.\n\nAny payments made direct to others on your behalf should also be included e.g. payments made by an ex-partner directly to the mortgage company for the former matrimonial home.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-pension\">Pension income</h3>\n\nNote that any pensions paid under the Naval, Military or Air Forces are disregarded.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-other_income\">Other income</h3>\n\nOther income from investments and employee benefits such as company car and fuel allowances.\n\nPlease note that any income or assistance that has been made available from other sources, e.g. assistance from friends or relatives with bills, should be treated as income and included here\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-self_employed\">Are you self employed?</h3>\n\nIf client has both employment and self-employment select 'no' as they will be eligible for the additional \u00a345 allowance.\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-dependants_over_16\">Children aged 16 and over</h3>\n\nThe number and age of your children affects how much you can earn and still be eligible for legal aid. The rules are different for young people over 16 and children aged 15 or under. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-dependants_under_16\">Children aged 15 and under</h3>\n\nThe number and age of your children affects how much you can earn and still be eligible for legal aid. The rules are different for young people over 16 and children aged 15 or under. \n\n## Expenses\n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-expenses_mortgage\">Mortgage</h3>\n\nHomeowner payments to a bank or building society. Check your most recent mortgage or bank statement. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-expenses_rent\">Rent</h3>\n\nMoney you pay your landlord to live in your home. Check your most recent bank statement or rentbook. \n\n<h3 id=\"ecg-expenses_tax\">Tax</h3>\n\nMoney deducted from your pay by your employer - check your most recent payslip.
