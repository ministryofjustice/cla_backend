# This workflow performs Software Composition Analysis (SCA) on the repository
# to identify security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in dependencies.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Daily scheduled run at midnight UTC (cron: "0 0 * * *")
#   - Pull requests targeting the main branch
#   - Pushes to the main branch
#   - Manual workflow dispatch
#   - Branch protection rule events
#
# Workflow Structure:
#   1. setup job: Initializes environment variables and timezone settings
#      - Outputs environment and timezone for downstream jobs
#
#   2. sca job: Executes the Software Composition Analysis
#      - Requires setup job completion
#      - Checks out repository code
#      - Sets up Node.js environment using version from repository variables
#      - Installs npm dependencies without running scripts
#      - Runs SCA using ministryofjustice/devsecops-actions
#
# Permissions:
#   - Minimal permissions at workflow level (empty permissions block)
#   - SCA job has specific permissions for:
#     - Writing to contents, pull requests, issues, and security events
#     - Reading actions
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to "base" for the workflow execution environment
#   - timezone: Configurable via repository variables
#
# Required Secrets:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN: Used for authentication in SCA action
#
# Configuration Files:
#   - dependency-review-config.yml: Optional configuration for dependency review
#   - sources.json: Optional file containing Docker images to scan
